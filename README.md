# Shark Game

Shark Game is a web game made entirely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript by Cirrial. It is a game belonging to the "idle" or "incremental" genre. It does not require constant player attention, and can progress while the player does other things before returning to it. This isn't in any way a new or pioneering concept - a lot of people have probably heard of Candy Box or A Dark Room, or the more popular contemporary Cookie Clicker.

## Development Plan

Cirrial originally developed this game for Seamergency 2014, but continued to develop it afterward. It quickly became a niche favorite among idle game enthusiasts. After a string of updates, Cirrial dropped development in mid-2015. The final version is v0.71.

While the game is in a more-than-playable state, it remains unfinished. This mod, dubbed New Frontiers, intends to finish what Cirrial started, and then move on to reimagine the game and its world.

This repository holds the second step of development, which is to reimagine each of the worlds as unique places with individually significant and different gameplay elements, along with UI improvements and overhauls to major game mechanics.

Contributions welcome.



# I don't know what to do help please

I want to add a "tropical" world to Shark Game, which will likely add axolotls as the new species as well as new materials, as my contribution to a game I fell in love with years ago. Only time will tell if I will be able to pull this off, wish me luck

## The "Plan"

1. Figure out what editor to use for this, as I've never done a browser game before (in progress, I think)
2. Add the world type and important details
2a. Come up with the description of the world as it will display for scouting, and for normal visits
2b. Decide what resources will and will not be present
2c. Decide what, if any, modifiers the world will have
3. Add axolotls and relevant materials
4. Add art(?)
